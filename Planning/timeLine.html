<!-- Planing -->

Day 1. Thursday (2016.07.07) <!-- Getting started -->
  1. Decide Game Type
  2. Produce time line 
  3. Writing daily-objective of project
  4. Draw Game Framework 
    -Drawing out basic web page layout.
    -Drawing out basic game feature.

Day 2. Friday (2016.07.08) <!-- Logic functioning -->
  1. HTML: create 6x6 main game blocks framework;
  2. CSS: to have one block styled;<!-- git it -->
  3. Javascript: add key event listeners for arrow up, down, left, right to this block, and console.log to test;<!-- git it --> [
  Probably do 'click' first to get the MVP works]
  4. Javascript: allow to locate the adjacent left, up, right, down according to the arrow, by using ".next()" or ".nextAll.eq(n)";<!-- git it --> [Probably create an array for the block, so easier to call the blocks, depends on how it goes]
  5. Javascript: allow to .addClass to the adjacent block. 
  6. Add a reset button to remove the added class. 
  7. Test: should allow the styled block to move accross and asign class to all the 6x6 blocks; <!-- git it -->
  <!-- Must Get Above to work -->
  8. Javascript: add click event listener to the styled block, allows the key event listener activate only after you clicked; <!-- git it -->
  9. CSS: to style another block with different class (color);
  10. Javascript: in the key event listener, to access if the adjacent block's have class or not.<!-- git it -->
  11. Javascript: then add a 'if' condition to enable it will only add class when the adjacent block have no class name.
  12. CSS: to style another block with the same class and assign it an id;<!-- git it -->
  13. Javascript: in the previous 'if' condition, also check if the adjacent block have the id, if so, then stop, because this is the destination.<!-- git it -->
  14. CSS: maybe allow all the block with the class to flash when complete if have time left.

Day 3. Saturday (2016.07.09) <!-- Logic implementation, win condition and repeat this for various difficulties level -->
  1. CSS: create 6 class in total for different colors, and create 2 blocks for each color onto the 6x6 game framework;<!-- git it -->
  2. Javascript: apply the logic from day 2 to the blocks;<!-- git it -->
  3. Javascript: create win condition when all the blocks are assigned class. ()<!-- git it -->
  4. Javascript: create count down timer for the game;
  5. Javascript: create lose condition when all the blocks are not assigned class when timer goes to zero;<!-- git it -->
  6. Javasceipt: allow to reset the framework when the user loses and clicked the reset button. <!-- git it -->
  7. Javascript: allow to load the new framework when the user wins and clicked the next challenge button. 
  8. Javascript: create the second framework, with different 12 blocks positions. <!-- git it -->
  9. Javascript: link this framework to the logic from day 2, probably need to update to constructor and OOP <!-- git it -->
  10. Javascript: repeat for severl more designed framwork;<!-- git it -->
  11. Javascript: create a strating page. which allows to choose 6x6, 8x8 and 9x9;
  <!-- Must Get Above to work -->
  12. Javascript: for 8x8 and 9x9; produce a larger framwork but more starting blocks (add more colors).

Day 4. Sunday (2016.07.10) <!-- create more framework for 8x8 and 9x9 and styling-->
  1. Javascript: create more framwork for 8x8 and 9x9; <!-- git it -->
